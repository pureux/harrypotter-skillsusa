# Harry Potter New House Petition

## 2020 Skills USA Web Design Competition

A web design exercise based on the Harry Potter franchise, extending the storyline by promoting the creation of new house (group) for students at Hogwarts.

## Requirements

A group of Hogwarts students who disagreed with which house the Sorting Hat sorted them in is petitioning for the creation of a new house (aka group) to accompany and compete against Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. They have enlisted you to help design and build a web site for them.

Come up with and incorporate the following unique attributes for the new house:

* Name
* Qualities it values (4 of them)
* Emblem (typically an animal)
* Colors (1 primary and 1 accent)

These should be both representative of the group and visually appealing, but also distinct from the other four houses.

For reference:

| House | Qualities | Emblem | Color |
| ----- | --------- | ------ | ----- |
| Gryffindor | courage<br/>bravery<br/>nerve<br/>chivalry | lion | red and yellow |
| Hufflepuff | hard work<br/>patience<br/>justice<br/>loyalty | badger | yellow and brown |
| Ravenclaw | intelligence<br/>creativity<br/>learning<br/>wit | raven | blue and gray |
| Slytherin | ambition<br/>cunning<br/>leadership<br/>resourcefulness | snake | green and gray |

Design your own logo (aka crest) using the emblem you decided on, matching the general theme and style of other house crests at Hogwarts (it does not have to be as detailed as those used in the movie).

Design and implement a web site for the proposed new Hogwarts house, incorporating your new logo, color scheme, and other house attributes.

Include separate pages (as well as navigation) for:

| Page | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| Home | News content and a brief call to action for why the new house should be created |
| About | General content about the new house, as well as a Google map or other interaction map visualization to depict the house's dormitory location at Hogwarts (pick a location in Europe to visualize, and ideally have the map zoomed in to a specific area of a large building/complex) |
| Sign the Petition | A form for the user to fill out and submit to sign the petition, including their name, email address, and optional comments, including validation of required fields and email address format |

The web site should be responsive for mobile phones, tablets, and desktops/laptops.  It should be cross-browser compatible and meet W3C standards. It should meet the WCAG accessibility guidelines.

You *can* use the Internet, including graphic design resources, fonts, and images you find on the web.  However, the house name, logo, color scheme, and qualities valued must be your own unique ideas and cannot be copied from existing work.

You *cannot* use frameworks, libraries, or other imilar tools (examples: Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery, React, Vue, Angular, etc.).  If you are unsure about using something, ask one of the judges.
